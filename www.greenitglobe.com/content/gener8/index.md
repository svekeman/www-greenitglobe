## Generic Usable Cloud Units

Our cloud units are so flexible it allows you to build any required workload.
Going from a small environment for couple of virtual machines to a 10 petabyte archive.

### Generic Cloud Platform

Our racks instantly provide IT infrastructure produced as cloud units. 
Combining cloud units provide you with scale-out capacity for storage, compute and performance.

- Our hyperconverged racks provision has both fast storage and dense compute capacity for heavy IT production workloads.
- Our units are agnostic to used technology, you can use this to provison high performance virtual machines, secure virtual datacenters or desktops. All is possible.  

#### 1 rack would deliver 

- 2,189 Compute Units
- 1,512 Storage Units
- 9,626 Transaction units

#### Which corresponds to

* 8,400 net usable GB memory
* 2,100 logical CPU cores
    * 1,400,000 passmark performance
* 1.5 Petabyte Ultra Reliable Netto Usable Storage
* 50TB Ultra High Performance SSD Capacity
* redundant 56 gbit/sec internal network backplane
* 1,000,000 IOPs (IO Operations Per Second)

#### Comparison To Standard clouds

* at least 10x more IO Operations (IOPS) per virtual machine
* unlimited snapshots, you can go back in time for any of your virtual disks
* secure virtual private datacenters
* self healing automation framework
* dedicated CPU Capacity


### Archive Use Case: 10 Petabyte Archive System

This compares to capacity needed for 

- 3,500,000 DVD movies
- 5,000,000,000 high definition pictures
- many thousands of hours high definition surveillance camera storage.

#### this system would deliver you

- 10,000 Storage Units
- 720 Compute Units
- 17,000 Transaction units

#### Which corresponds to

* 10 Petabyte Ultra Reliable Netto Usable Storage
* 200 TB/hour processing performance (for big data manipulations)

#### This system only requires

* 2 kwatt to operate
* 10 hours per month to manage (which is orders of magnitude less)
* 40m2 solar panels if you want to go 100% green

#### Comparison To Any Standard Archive System

* 100% self healing
* extremely reliable
* protection against bitrot (data corruption gets auto-recovered)


### High Performance Storage System

We can fit 5 petabyte of netto high performance storage in a single rack. 

* Petabyte archive building block, no limits to scalability
* Power-friendly, extreem low electrivity requirement
* Self-healing and regenarating storage
* Simplified interfaces, standard fileserver
* Digital preservation is possible for 30+ years

#### Technical

* 5 PB
* NAS & SAN Interface
* Redundant 56 Gbit/sec ethernet
* 5,000 MB/sec ingest speed
* 4,000,000 IOPs (IO Operations Per Second)
* Rack mountable system

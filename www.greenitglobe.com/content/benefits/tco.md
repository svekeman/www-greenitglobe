### Server virtualization!

* Collapsed technology layers
Hyper converged is all about eliminating layers of communciation and integration between computer, storage and networking
resources.  Eliminating layers means eliminating overhead and complexity which leads to less integration work, less components
needed and less technology licenses required to operated the solution.

* Self healing and 0-touch maintenance
All hardware required to operated the solution is standard x86 bare metal hardware.  When hardware breaks the intelligent
software will detect this and rendors the compute of storage component / node as defective.  The software will re-organise the
workload to no longer include the defective node of component.  We recommend not to replace the defective components but to 
cater for additional capacity to account for the loss of capacaity due to this defective node and for busienss as asual 
capacity growth.  This minimises the risk of operational staff mistakingly taking part of the infrastucture offline and risking
damage to or loss of data by human error.

* Automation and analytics
As all of the intelligence is delivered by software a very high percentage of repetitive and maintenance tasks can be automated 
in the software.  This frees up resources in the IT department to be involved in projects that present creative support and 
innovation to the rest of the business, helping the business in general to achieve it's targets.

* Intelligent software, not hardware
The intelligence of our sollutions is embedded in the software that runs on bare metal, standard x86 hardware.  No specific
hardware and accelarators are requires for the solution to run which brings enormous cost savings.  Compared to some components
vendors this makes a huge difference in investments and operational costs.

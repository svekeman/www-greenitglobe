disc = "Use of video surveillance in business is growing, creating new challenges related to 
managing surveillance systems and storing the rapidly increasing volume of raw video footage.
Organizations are using video surveillance mostly as a tool to enhance safety and security. 
Most organizations use more than 200 cameras that are running non- stop around the clock—with no
end in sight. The number of cameras and the value of video analytics are only expected to grow. 

System maintenance is the top video surveillance storage challenge for end users, the next 
biggest challenge is to keep expanding the capacity. If surveillance footage is deleted before 
60 days, most respondents say it’s a data storage capacity issue—not a reflection of perceived value of the footage.. 

GreenITGlobe uses it's hyperconverged and hyperscalable solutions to provide ultra scalable 
compute and storage resources to run the worlds leading Video Management Systems (VMS) software 
packages with minimal requirements of system maintenance and capacity management workloads."
